# attribute-validation-patterns

Contains reference implementations for validating and normalsing data attributes for use on the Customer Insights Platform (CIP).

## Usage

This code is not a servce or a library, instead you should refer to these patterns to ensure you have the best experience when trying to bring together data from different sources. While this code does not produce any artefacts, it is a form of living documentation and contains tests that can be run to verify the implementation.

Please be aware that best practices could change over time so it's best to check back here every month or so.
